## Welcome!

Welcome to the repository of the Trades Labour Cost AppÔºÅ

Thank you for visiting the project, hope all of you can enjoy exploring the trades labour costs.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

As a project estimator in the construction industry, what is the weekly labour cost for different scenarios when working with various trades and shift schedule?

This seems like a simple question to be answered. However, when dealing with a large number of trade unions that all have different rates and conditions, a quick tool is needed for estimators to check with different scenarios and figure out best options of shift for a particular project.

### The solution

The Trades Labour Cost App will:

-   Enable estimators in the construction industry to effectively and efficiently compare weekly labour costs for different trades (currently the app only includes boilermaker, millwright, ironworker, and pipefitter trades in four union locals) and for different shift options.
-   Help estimators to manage various of wage/benefit rates, overall labour costing via data visualization.

## Description of App

The Dash app contains two main panels.

On the left side, from the radio butters, users will select the type of trades they are interested, and also through a drop-down, they can choose four commonly used work shift options.

On the right side, there are two data tables to show the comparison of weekly labour costs per trades, and the comparison of weekly labour costs per shift type. The results are automatically updated according to the user's selections on the left side.

We are planning to add more data and more features in the app in the future to make it more valuable to solve practical industrial problems. Currently, there are below assumptions to be aware of by users:

-   Hourly rates include wage and benefit according to the union agreements, and on top of them, all the employer responsible CPP/EI contributions have also been added. However, other costs, such as living out allowance, meal allowance not included.

-   Referring to the proposal of this project, currently the weekly trades labour cost results obtained from the app is only applicable for four exclusively mentioned union locals.
